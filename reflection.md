###What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

I learned about the margin auto and how it changes the margin depending on the content of the element. This is handy for creating a dynamic web page that changes its margins to keep the content in a specific position regardless of browser window size.

###What did you learn about CSS positioning?

It's a time consuming process that you can spend hours on trying to get just right. I think timeboxing helps here so you don't get sucked into playing with the positions and getting burnt out.

###What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

Text styles was the easiest thing to implement. The hardest was positioning the elements so they line up regardless of the browser window size.

###What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

I learned a lot about using classes to quickly format different elements on different pages. It's a very powerful tool being able to link css files to different pages and being able to format sections the same using classes.
