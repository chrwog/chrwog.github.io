<!--
How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

It was an overall good experience. We both already had an idea of what we wanted our blog page to look like and shared our individual wireframes with each other. We decided to work with mine for this lesson since it would be a little easier to implement than my partners.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

Yes. It helps with getting an idea of what the page will look like. It also helped having another set of eyes on it and make suggestions.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 

We decided to have a header section on top with a horizontal navigation bar below it. Below that, an article section for the blog links and a footer at the bottom.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

I learned about the difference between a non semantic element like a <div>, and a semantic one like <article>. I learned about the <nav> tag as well.
