          <p>
          First released in 2004 with permanent changes in 2005, Rails or Ruby on Rails is an open sourced web framework that uses the ruby programming language. It is used to provide general structures for database, web service, and web pages.  The main selling point of using Rails over other coding languages is its use of convention over configuration. This means Rails focuses on using implicit behaviors defined by the rails framework. This decreases the number of decisions that developers need to make, gaining simplicity and speed. Rails also provides pieces of code that you use will just work due to the rules of the framework and language. This reduces lines of code, as well as increases the speed of deployment which is another highlight of Rails.
          </p>
          <p>
          Since Ruby on Rails emphasizes not repeating yourself, developers are able to rapidly deploy prototypes and minimum viable products compared to other languages. Ruby gems or 3rd party libraries also speed up the coding process by providing pre built tools that a developer can use.
          </p>
          <p>
          There are many companies from startups to large corporations that use Rails on Ruby to develop their web applications. Some companies that have used Rails on Ruby include, Hulu, twitter, GitHub, and Groupon.
