            You may have heard of Git and Github. The two are intertwined within the developer community. It allows developers to develop programs without the fear of losing their work. It also helps them keep track of changes that are made on the projects they’re working on. Perhaps the biggest advantage to using Git and GitHub is that it allows multiple people to work on a project at the same time without the fear of messing up other people’s work.

              First let’s start with the Git. Git is a type of version control software. This particular software allows a person to work on files and save them with the ability to go back to an older version. It’s like going back in time. You can keep track of all these changes using some of the tools built into Git.

              GitHub although has the Git in it’s name is a completely different program. It is an online storage space to collect all of your files that you’ve changed with Git online. This allows you to access the files anywhere like dropbox or Google drive. Just like these cloud services, you can let other people view your GitHub collection, called repositories and make changes. This is a very powerful concept. Imagine having the task of creating a video game with 3 people. With GitHub you could have one person work on menus, the other on levels, and the other on sound. GitHub lets them upload their work and have the others review it before putting it in the game. If they needed to take a part of it out, say a level that isn’t working they could do that by reverting to an older version that didn’t include that level.
