          Before joining Devbootcamp I worked in IT Support for 5 years. Most recently I worked at a major corporation located in silicon valley. I think that the biggest issue that I saw during my time is the near abuse of contract work. As companies continue to look for ways to cut costs, one way that has been used is to hire workers on contract. The reason this cuts on costs is because of benefits. Basically contract workers aren't provided with benefits from the company. This includes health insurance, stock options, pensions, paid-time-off etc.
          </p>

          Thousands of temporary employees dubbed permatemps sued Microsoft in the 90's and won. The reason was Microsoft basically used these temps as full hires, without any of the full hire benefits.
          </p>

          <p>
          These days, companies skirt the issue by having mandatory extended breaks in between contracts. This way the temp workers are unemployed for a few months and can be hired back as temps again following the break.
          </p>

          I don't want to stir the pot too much, but I think it's in the best interest of people in the tech industry to be aware of these issues.
