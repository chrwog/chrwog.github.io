          <h1 class="title">Building a Website Reflection</h1>
<p>
It's amazing how fast the past 9 weeks have gone by. I've gone from knowing near nothing about coding to coding my own basic programs and building a small website. Granted this is still just the very beginning of my journey, it is nice to know that I can see and feel the progress that I'm making in this field. I'm sure once the onsite portion of DBC starts, things will get more intense, but for now I'll just take a moment to stop and look where I've come from.
</p>
<p>I've really enjoyed the pair programming and being able to see how others think and solve problems. Before DBC I didn't realize how much collaboration we would be doing while coding. I always figured that coding is something you do on your own.
For the website, I've enjoyed most of the visual things like adding effects and transitions to elements. I'm definitely a visual person.
</p>
<p>
JavaScript has been particularly challenging for me. After starting to make headway with Ruby, the class switched languages. I can see the potential of JavaScript, but I miss the speed and ease of use that Ruby has. This especially true for the error messages that the languages give you. I find that it's easier for me to understand the error messages in Ruby than JavaScript.
</p>
<p>
What was most challenging developing the website was getting elements positioned the way I want, especially when changing the window size. There were often times I would have the layout the way I wanted, until I changed the window size.
</p>
<p>
Over Phase-0 I've learned so much. Like mentioned earlier, I think the biggest thing I learned about developing is how much collaboration takes place. Since we paired at least two times a week, I've become more comfortable working with others trying to solve challenges. I was nervous in the beginning, but my fears were quickly lost once I realized that everybody is in the same boat with the same goal.
</p>
<p>
Another thing I've learned is how many different ways there are in solving problems. Since we peer reviewed a lot of the assignments, it was amazing to see how people solved the same problems different ways. It just shows you how creative people can be when solving something and that nearly anything is possible with coding.
</p>
<p>
I've also learned that since we spent so much time on Ruby and JavaScript, I had to remind my self to keep up with HTML and CSS so I wouldn't lose those skills. By continuing to develop my website, I hope to keep the skills fresh, and to learn more techniques.
